# RAILS/REACT LEVEL UP MATHEMATICS KIDS GAME APPLICATION
    For my final project at [FLATIRON SCHOOL](https://flatironschool.com/), I created a children's math game application, where child could sign in to the application and learn math by levels. 

## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES USED
    I used the following programming languages:
    - RUBY ON RAILS
    - REACT JSX
    - JAVASCRIPT
    - CSS
## HOW TO USE
    On start-up you will see a Login Page where a potential user could either register or login. Once signed in, user is redirected to the Dashboard. The application is truly a one page application as the user doesn't leave the dashboard. This was done with the user (children) in mind. Most little children learning Math aren't going to have the capability to handle complex menus. 

	On the Dashboard, your current user level is accessed once you click the button to begin the game. If your is currently at Level 1, they will be shown Level 1. User needs to get enough points to level up!

### Instructions
	Complete each level to move to the next.
	Each correct answer awards 5 points. Earn 45 points in your level to move to the next.Can you get to the TOP?	

### Levels
	- Level 1: Addition
	- Level 2: Subtraction
	- Level 3: Multiplication
	- Level 4: Division
